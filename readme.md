# Project Folder Structure

This project contains a variety of algorithms and operations organized into different folders. Below is a list of the folders with clickable links to their contents:

## Folders:

- [2024-maj](./2024-maj)  
  Contains files related to the 2024 major project.

- [array fill](./array%20fill)  
  Contains algorithms or scripts that focus on filling arrays with specific values.

- [median](./median)  
  Contains code for calculating the median of a set of numbers.

- [NWD](./NWD)  
  Contains implementations for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) using different methods.
  - [euclidean](./NWD/euclidean)  
    Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.
  - [positive only](./NWD/positive%20only)  
    GCD calculation considering only positive numbers.

- [prime factors](./prime%20factors)  
  Contains code to determine the prime factors of a number.

- [sort](./sort)  
  Contains various sorting algorithms:
  - [bubble](./sort/bubble)  
    Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
  - [bucket](./sort/bucket)  
    Implementation of the bucket sort algorithm.
  - [insertion](./sort/insertion)  
    Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
  - [quick](./sort/quick)  
    Implementation of the quicksort algorithm.

- [swap](./swap)  
  Contains code for swapping elements in an array or list.
